## Project Overview
The “HR Employee Dashboard” project aims to provide insights into employee demographics and distribution within the company. It utilizes an open-source HR dataset containing over 22,000 rows from the years 2000 to 2020. The data was ingested into MySQL for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and subsequent analysis. The final interactive dashboard was built using Microsoft Power BI, enhancing user experience with aesthetics and usability.

## Key Questions Addressed
The solution addresses the following key questions:

**1. Gender Breakdown:**
- What is the distribution of employees by gender in the company?
- This analysis helps understand gender representation and identify any gender-related disparities.

**2. Race/Ethnicity Breakdown:**
- How diverse is the company in terms of race and ethnicity?
- By examining the racial and ethnic composition of employees, we can promote inclusivity and diversity.

**3. Age Distribution:**
- What is the age distribution of employees?
- Understanding the age demographics allows us to tailor HR policies and benefits effectively.

**4. Headquarters vs. Remote Locations:**
- How many employees work at the company’s headquarters versus remote locations?
- This insight helps optimize resource allocation and assess the feasibility of remote work arrangements.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
- Dataset:
The open-source HR dataset contains information such as employee IDs, names, birthdates, gender, ethnicity, location, and employment details.

- ETL Process:
  - Data Extraction: Extracted relevant columns from the dataset.
  - Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed data (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing ethnicity categories).
  - Data Loading: Loaded the processed data into MySQL for further analysis.

## Analysis and Visualization
**Microsoft Power BI:**
  - Leveraged Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
  - Visualizations include:
    - Bar chart for gender breakdown.
    - Line chart of employees employed in each year.
    - Bar chart for race/ethnicity breakdown.
    - Bar chart for age distribution.
    - Pie chart for headquarters vs. remote locations.

## Conclusion
The “HR Employee Dashboard” provides actionable insights for HR and management. By regularly updating the dashboard, the company can make informed decisions related to workforce diversity, age-related policies, and location-based resource allocation.
